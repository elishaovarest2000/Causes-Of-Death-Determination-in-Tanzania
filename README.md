# Causes Of Death Determination in Tanzania
 1.1. General Introduction It has been estimated that in low-income countries like Tanzania large percentage of deaths occur at home, which highlights the importance of routine verbal autopsy to determine the causes of death in these settings. There are few hospitals and health services as well as low ration between physician and patient in Tanzania. There are also many adults who have serious illnesses like cancer that take a long time to treat and also require enough money, so it sometimes results in skipping the schedule and not meeting the patient's needs for services.
